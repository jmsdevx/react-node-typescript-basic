# React / NodeJs Basic Skeleton

This repository is a really basic barebones development config for personal learning projects using the create-react-app on the front end, and Typescript with Node.

##### Details
Webpack restarts on Typescript changes and restarts the node server automatically. This is really the only custom part of the project, as the front end is using the create-react-app that is well documented.

##### Installation
If you want to fiddle around with the repository run the following commands.
```
npm install
npm run start-backend
```
The site will be running on `localhost:3001`.
